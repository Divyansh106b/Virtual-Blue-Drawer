# Virtual-Blue-Drawer
A virtual drawing tool that tracks a blue object in real-time and draws based on its movement using OpenCV.


This project is a computer vision-based virtual drawing tool that allows users to **draw on the screen using a blue-colored object**, such as a pen cap or marker. It detects only blue in a webcam feed and draws as you move the object in real-time.

## **Privacy Note**

The demo intentionally does not show the user's face. Only the drawing activity is visible, as a conscious decision to maintain privacy.
